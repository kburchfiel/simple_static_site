# Selected output from the mapping section of Python for Nonprofits

This simple webpage provides links to six maps created within
the [Mapping](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/tree/main/Mapping) section
of [Python for Nonprofits](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn). It is meant
to demonstrate how visualizations can be hosted within 
a static GitHub Pages website.

## Population growth maps

These maps visualize population growth rates at the state and county
level **from 2011 to 2021.** They were created using the Plotly graphing
library within PFN's choropleth_maps.ipynb notebook, available at
https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/blob/main/Mapping/choropleth_maps.ipynb .

**Note: Certain maps will be easier to view on a laptop or monitor than
on your phone.**

## Net domestic migration maps

These maps show net domestic migration rates at the state and
county level **from 2020 to 2023**. They are based on the Folium mapping
library and were created within PFN's
choropleth_maps_with_folium.ipynb notebook, available at
https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/blob/main/Mapping/choropleth_maps_with_folium.ipynb .
